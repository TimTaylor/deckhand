Description: Generate {pagedown} reports for data heavy publications. Often 
    these types of reports have been laid out using presentation software and
    therefore called "slide decks" even though they aren't presented but turned
    into PDFs and printed. A deckhand is an experienced seaman in the merchant
    navy who helps with the general running of a ship, the {deckhand} package
    helps you produce your report.
